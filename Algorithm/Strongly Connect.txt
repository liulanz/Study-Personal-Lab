A graph is strongly connected if there is a path from any node to all other
nodes in the graph. 


The strongly connected components of a graph divide the graph into
strongly connected parts that are as large as possible.




Kosarajuâ€™s algorithm1
is an efficient method for finding the strongly connected
components of a directed graph. The algorithm performs two depth-first searches:
the first search constructs a list of nodes according to the structure of the graph,
and the second search forms the strongly connected components
